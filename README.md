  ## Summary of Findings
  <Show the variations studied in a table>

  Summarized what was accomplished in this study.  Describe 2-4 observations from simulating the flight path.
  Reference the figures below as needed.

  *If the analysis falls short of the goal, this is your chance to explain what was done or what were the barriers.*
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does.  The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.


  # Figures

  ## Fig. 1: Single Parameter Variation

In this figure you see two sets of three simulations. The first set shows a standard flight profile with three simulations run with the nominal, and lower and higher initial values of initial velocity (shown in black, red and green respectively).
The second set shows a similar procedure this time modifying the initial flight path angle.



  ## Fig. 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

This figure shows a randomly produced set of 100 flight profiles, where each had a randomized initial velocity and initial flight path angle. The initial values of the two variables are associated with the color of each individual trial, as described in the legend. (where V is velocity and Gam is the flight path angle gamma).

Overlaid on top of the simulations is a 5th degree line of fit for the 100 flights (yellow) and an average (by time) flight path (magenta).
